                              <p>Doris Johnston heard the crash from across 
                                the street. The alarm on her new Volvo station wagon went 
                                off immediately. Carson, the German shepherd that belongs 
                                to her son David, immediately began to bark and wouldn't stop 
                                for another hour.<br><br>
                                "I thought a tree had fallen onto the neighbor's house," 
                                she says.<br><br>
                                It was just after midnight and Ralph Essex and his wife Ellen 
                                were entering into the final hand of their monthly bridge 
                                club. Sixteen friends who had never left a bridge game unfinished 
                                found themsleves scrambling into the front yard to see what 
                                had happened.<br><br>
                                "It sounded like a bomb," said Carolyn Watts, last 
                                week's reigning bridge champion. "I honestly thought 
                                some kid had finally set off a bomb."<br><br>
                                By 12:30 AM a crowd of several dozen had assembled in the 
                                street in front of the large white house at 2710 Powderham 
                                Drive in the exclusive Country Club section of Sarasota Heights. 
                                <br><br>
                                The home owned by Edward and Rose Darko was soon surrounded 
                                by fire engines and police cars. Screaming could be heard 
                                from inside.</p>
                              <p>"I could hear Eddie and Rose screaming 
                                their son's name, over and over. It was just awful," 
                                said JoAnne Smith, a close friend of the Darkos. "I got 
                                a call and we rushed over to the house and the police wouldn't 
                                let us inside. We knew something terribly shocking had happened. 
                                No one could have predicted something as bizarre as this." 
                                <br><br>
                                The thing that no one could have predicted was the right engine 
                                from a commercial 747 commercial airliner, which crashed mysteriously 
                                into the bedroom of sixteen-year old Donald Darko, a local 
                                honor student at Middlesex Ridge School.<br><br>
                                Over the next six agonizing hours, the family waited as Federal 
                                Aviation Administration authorities brought in their crash 
                                unit, who quickly found themselves searching the surrounding 
                                area for a downed plane.</p>
                              <p>As sunrise approached, workers finally hoisted 
                                the 2000 pound jet engine from the house. <br><br>
                                Donald Darko was found crushed to death in the rubble.<br><br>
                                Crash Investigators were alarmed that the house had sustained 
                                so little damage, given massive impact damage sustained by 
                                housing structures in similar crash scenarios, casting speculation 
                                as to how low the plane was flying. <br><br>
                                Workers assembled by the FAA Accident Investigation Projects 
                                Review Team (AIPRT) evacuated the house and began to sift 
                                through the wreckage, hoping to find clues to this mysterious 
                                event, which appears to have left little evidence. <br><br>
                                Air Traffic Control at Dulles International Airport and Richmond 
                                International Airport have received no distress signals, nor 
                                have there been any reports of a crash over a 10,000 mile 
                                search radius. Search and rescue units have thus far reported 
                                no evidence of the whereabouts of any missing plane.<br><br>
                                Calls to the office of AIPRT Lead Investigator Bob Garland 
                                were not returned, as the investigation continues in an unnamed 
                                warehouse in Northern Alexandria.<br><br>
                                As the engine was taken away on a flatbed truck and the body 
                                of a young man loaded into an ambulance, neighbors watched 
                                with a sense of sadness and bewilderment, unsure of what had 
                                truly transpired.<br><br>
                                It appears to be a feeling shared by just about everyone.
