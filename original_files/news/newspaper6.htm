                    Today is the three year anniversary of the events that occured 
                    on October 2, 1988<br>
                    <br>
                    Engine X came falling from the sky, killing a young man. His 
                    name, Darko, now part of our local legend, continues to be 
                    the subject of endless speculation. <br>
                    <br>
                    His family has moved west to California. They did not return 
                    this reporter's calls. This I understand, as the mystery of 
                    that night must weigh so much more in their hearts and minds 
                    than it does in ours.<br>
                    <br>
                    Attempts to retrieve information from the Federal Aviation 
                    Administration have become futile, as their spokesperson simply 
                    releases the same statement. <br>
                    &quot;The investigation is ongoing,&quot; he says. </p>
                  <p><br>
                    Rumors that President Bush has visited the secret wherehouse 
                    in Washington that stores the engine have been the latest 
                    to surface, and once again nothing can be confirmed.</p>
                  <p>We are told of a vast conspiracy, of a plane that they know 
                    exists. We are told of flight trajectories, serial numbers, 
                    and low impact velocity. The technical jargon is endless and 
                    fascinating. Yet there is no evidence. There is nothing but 
                    Engine X, an artifact from that night.</p>
                  <p> <br>
                    A bomb that fell upon our quiet community has left behind 
                    so many questions that we must now accept that there will 
                    never be answers. </p>
