well, life isn't that simple. I mean - who cares if Ling Ling returns the 
wallet and keeps the money? It has nothing to do with either fear or 
love. there are other things that need to be taken into account here, 
like... the whole spectrum of human emotion. 
you can't just lump everything into these two categories and then just deny everything else.
