&t3=[CALLER 1]: Hello?

&t4=[CALLER 2]: Yes, is this [NAME WITHHELD]?

&t5=[CALLER 1]: Yes.

&t6=[CALLER 2]: This is [NAME WITHHELD]. I apologize for calling you at home, but I am calling from London and this appears to be a very urgent matter.

&t7=[CALLER 1]: I understand. What have you got for me?

&t8=[CALLER 2]: We have run the tests on the engine parts that you sent to Heathrow and I have some rather conclusive results to share with you.

&t9=[CALLER 1]: Do we have a match?

&t10=[CALLER 2]: Indeed we do. The parts from engine x that you sent appear to be exact replicas from the [NAME WITHHELD] 747 that just returned from Honolulu. We have compared the serial numbers and they are exact matches.    

&t11=[CALLER 1]: Are you sure of this? I need confirmation on all of the parts sent. 

&t12=[CALLER 2]: Not only can I give you confirmation on all of the parts, I can confirm that the handpainted spiral is identical to the [NAME WITHHELD] 747 design. We have detailed proof that the designs are identical down to the fraction of an inch.

&t13=[CALLER 2]: Now I am at a loss as to how an exact replica of this engine could have fallen from a plane in your country on the evening in question. I have charted the flight records from this aircraft and I can confirm that this plane was en route to San Francisco from Denver, Colorado on the night of October 2, 1988. It landed safely at approximately 4:30 in the morning. We have confirmation on this plane as having been fully operational for international and domestic flights for more than six years.

&t14=[CALLER 2]: I must tell you that we are all at a loss as to how this could have occured. It appears to defy logical explanation and we are all quite astonished with the information we have retrieved.

&t15=[CALLER 2]: How would you like to proceed in this matter?

&t16=[CALLER 2]: Hello? Are you still there? Hello?
